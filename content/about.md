I'm a Research Software Engineer at the [Lean FRO](https://lean-fro.org/) as well as a computer science
masters student at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/). My current work is mostly related to verified
decision procedures in Lean 4. Beyond my theorem proving interests I also enjoy low level
tinkering on embedded devices as well as performance tuning a lot.
